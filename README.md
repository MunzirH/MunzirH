## Hi there 👋 I'm Munzir Hashim Abdulmajid

🚀 Data Scientist at Jacobs | 💡 Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher  | 🌐 Cloud Enthusiast

I’m passionate about transforming data into impactful solutions! At Jacobs, I use Azure OpenAI to drive data innovation on high-profile projects like NEOM, SoundTransit in Seattle, and the AMTRAK Frederick Douglass Tunnel. I also have experience building AI-driven tools and solutions using Foundry by Palantir, enabling smarter decision-making and efficient collaboration through our Alluvial platform.

🔬 Background: Former researcher at UW (in the CSE and Mechanical Engineering Departments), where I developed advanced methods integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and sparse system identification (SINDy) to discover governing equations from limited, noisy data—pushing the boundaries of model discovery in complex systems. I also designed a 3D-printed U-joint robotic arm with independent motion capabilities and implemented a vaccine reservation system using Azure and Python. As a project manager, I led initiatives like [AccessMap](https://www.accessmap.app/?region=wa.seattle&lon=-122.334298&lat=47.606386&z=13) for accessible routing and OpenSideWalks to enhance urban mobility.
