## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Munzir Abdulmajid, a passionate Data Scientist at Jacobs, where I drive data innovation and create impactful solutions through advanced analytics, machine learning, and cloud-native tools. As one of the early adopters of OpenAI's GPT models, I leverage cutting-edge AI to transform data insights and streamline processes across high-profile projects. My experience spans major initiatives, including the NEOM city development, and prominent government projects like the AMTRAK Frederick Douglass Tunnel program and SoundTransit in Seattle.

I've supported big clients such as Intel, the New York City Department of Design and Construction, and the Government of Singapore. Within Jacobs, I lead the [Alluvial platform](https://customers.microsoft.com/en-us/story/1655187821653342085-jacobs-microsoft-fabric-power-bi-partner-professional-services-usa), enabling seamless stakeholder collaboration and cost-efficient resource sharing across various domains. You can learn more about my perspective on the future of data science in my [Jacobs interview](https://www.jacobs.com/newsroom/qa/view-future-data-science-qa-munzir-abdulmajid).

Before joining Jacobs, I conducted research at the University of Washingtonâ€™s Mechanical Engineering Department. There, I developed a novel approach integrating physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with sparse identification of nonlinear dynamic systems (SINDy) to extract governing equations from scarce and noisy data for nonlinear spatiotemporal systems. Using SINDy on sparse shock wave data, I predicted the governing Burgerâ€™s equation with high accuracy (<0.90% error). I implemented ODEINT and RK45 solvers in Python to solve this equation and utilized automatic differentiation to develop PINNs for comparison. My findings demonstrated the superior robustness and accuracy of ODEINT compared to RK45 and PINNs.

Additionally, I oversaw the development of [AccessMap](https://www.accessmap.app/?region=wa.seattle&lon=-122.334298&lat=47.606386&z=13) at the Taskar Center as part of the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science, which provides accessible, customized routing directions to support individuals with mobility limitations.

I bring expertise in Generative AI and Machine Learning, Data Visualization and Project Management, constantly exploring innovative applications for real-world impact. Letâ€™s connect and discuss how data science can drive meaningful change!
