## Hi there 👋

🚀 Data Scientist at Jacobs | 💡 Machine Learning Engineer and Researcher  | 🌐 Cloud Enthusiast

I’m passionate about transforming data into impactful solutions! At Jacobs, I use Azure OpenAI to drive data innovation on high-profile projects like NEOM, SoundTransit in Seattle, and the AMTRAK Frederick Douglass Tunnel. I also have experience building AI-driven tools and solutions using Foundry by Palantir, enabling smarter decision-making and efficient collaboration through our Alluvial platform.

🔬 Background: Former researcher at UW, where I pioneered techniques combining neural networks and physics for advanced data insights.

💼 Clients: Intel, NEOM, AMTRAK, SoundTransit, NYC Department of Design & Construction, and Singapore's National Water Agency.
